                    The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the only 
                    probiotic formulation recommended and recognized by name in 
                    the American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the 
                    management of pouchitis and other pouch related disorders (Olleik 
                    et al., Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023).


                    The European Crohn s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) has included 
                    the De Simone Formulation in its guidelines for the management of 
                    Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023).

                    CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of  
                    various gastrointestinal conditions. The extensive scientific evidence, 
                    comprising over 200 peer reviewed articles and more than 80 
                    controlled clinical studies, ensures that the benefits observed in 
                    clinical trials are replicable in everyday us.

                    Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not 
                    simply the sum of its individual components but the result of a complex network of 
                    relationships between its microorganisms and the human host. Unlike many other 
                    products, the clinical results from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.<br><br>
        
                    CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and enzymatic 
                    profiles, calibrated in precise proportions to synergistically act on the physiology of the 
                    human gastrointestinal tract.
                    It is crucial to emphasize that the production of Formulazione De Simone falls within the 
                    field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product's base are living 
                    organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific know-how, 
                    protected by industrial secrecy.<br><br>
        
                    The unique know-how of Prof. Claudio De Simone contributes to the uniqueness and 
                    efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it highly effective in dietary management of dysbiosis 
                    and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering proven clinical results.

                    CDS22-formula supports the dietary management of intestinal dysbiosis, contributing to well-being in cases of intestinal 
disorders connected to irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and paucities.
<h2 class="heading">Control of intestinal dysbiosis</h2>

Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine is altered, causing various 
gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive health, improving patient comfort, and contributing 
to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.

<h2 class="heading">Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</h2>
CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces the severity and duration of symptoms, 
improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is particularly indicated for supporting intestinal health and can be beneficial in 
cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders characterized by accelerated transit that prevents normal daily activities or 
adequate night rest.

<h2 class="heading">Variety of Dosages:</h2>
Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to individual dietary needs, offering flexibility to 
healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.

<h2 class="heading">Original Formulation:</h2>
CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary bacterial strains designed to maximize 
intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in proprietary Master Cell Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and 
consistency in every production.

<h2 class="heading">Guaranteed Safety:</h2>
Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply chain approved by the inventor, the 
product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to packaging.

<h2 class="heading">Affordability:</h2>
CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities of bacteria. Efficient production and 
direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market

        <div class="text-content">
            <p>
                The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined 
                therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic 
                gastrointestinal disorders.
            <br><br>
                His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora's role was just beginning to be 
                understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and 
                Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L’Aquila (Italy).
            <br><br>
                He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.
            <br><br>
                Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and quality 
                control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.
            <br><br>
                As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not 
                correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De 
                Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).
            <br><br>
                Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and 
                safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.
